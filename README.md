##The Problem

City Council has a new initiative to handle graffiti in the city.  As new programs are developed to comabt the issues we need to make sure that these programs actuall effect graffitti.  We would like create a Graffiti Dashboard the shows graffiti in the city and how initaitives might be affecting it.

##Data 

Graffiti data is available using the publicsuff api at http://www.publicstuff.com/developers  
Please use the key - 58j013k159vpqz87xd85df0uy7epvl

Also please feel to use any data on the data portal that might help - http://opendatacatalog.ashevillenc.gov/

##Rules

Keep it simple. we are not looking for a finished product but minimal application that could start us down the path of something awesome.  

You may use, borrow other code.  But putting the app togher should be done by you.

##submitting the app

We really preffer to get submissions via GitHub and Show the working app via GitHUb pages.
